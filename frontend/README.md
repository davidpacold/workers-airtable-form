Workers Airtable Form Example (WIP)

An example project showing how to use Workers to handle form submissions. In this project, we use Airtable to persist data.

This project uses Tailwind CSS/Tailwind UI for layout details, though the bulk of the code lives in `Form.js` and the `worker` directory.
